# We use MAGIC_TEXT to separate text items or sentences within a block during translation, allowing us to split them back afterward.
# Translation APIs, like Google Translate, have a maximum text length they can handle. The idea of a block here
# represents a text blob that does not exceed that maximum length. 
# If we have many text elements or sentences to translate, we combine them into blocks, ensuring each block 
# does not exceed the maximum length. Each block contains several of these sentences separated by MAGIC_TEXT.
