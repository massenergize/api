## Welcome to MassEnergize's API!

🌍 **MassEnergize** is on a mission to tackle the climate emergency head-on! We work with community organizers and local leaders to supercharge household and community-level climate actions. Our open-source API is a crucial part of this mission, and we need YOU to join our team of eco-warriors!

**The Situation:** Mother Earth's throwing some serious shade our way (literally, with all this heat). We need a code-powered climate crusade!

**The Backend Team's Mission:** We're like climate action superheroes, except instead of capes, we rock awesome APIs! We empower everyday people to fight climate change with household-level solutions. Why? Because a million tiny changes add up to a HUGE impact
