## Overview of the different scripts

### BeforeInstall: 
The BeforeInstall script runs before any application files are copied to the instances. This script is typically used for preparing the instances for the deployment, such as backing up data, stopping services, or performing any necessary pre-installation tasks.

Example:
```
hooks:
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/backup.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

### AfterInstall: 
The AfterInstall script runs after the application files have been copied to the instances but before the application starts. This script is commonly used for tasks like installing dependencies, running database migrations, or performing any necessary post-installation steps.

Example:
```
hooks:
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/install_dependencies.sh
      timeout: 600
      runas: root
```

### ApplicationStart:
 The ApplicationStart script runs after the AfterInstall script finishes and is responsible for starting or restarting the application or any required services. This script is specific to your application and should include the necessary commands to start the application.

Example:
```
hooks:
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_server.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

### ValidationTest: 
The ValidationTest script runs after the ApplicationStart script and is used to validate that the application deployment was successful. This script should include tests or checks to ensure the application is running correctly. If the validation fails, CodeDeploy will roll back the deployment.

Example:
```
hooks:
  ValidationTest:
    - location: scripts/run_tests.sh
      timeout: 600
      runas: root
```
